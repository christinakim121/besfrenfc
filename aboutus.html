    <h1>About Besfren Beauty</h1>
    <p>Besfren is a multi-divisional company founded in 2012 inspired by Korean fairy tale "Moon Rabbit." The moon rises in the dark and shines over us-symbolizing hope and guidance, while rabbits playing with stone mortar and pestle represent pleasure of creation. We have successfully lauched our first artisan desset cafe Besfren in 2015, providing handmade desserts and delicate beverages with Korean craftmanship infused with New York's vibe.</p>
